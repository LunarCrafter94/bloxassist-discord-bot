# BloxAssist v0.10.0 — Development Changelog

> **Status:** In development on `development/v0.10.0`. This is not a published release. Changes and tests may still be revised before a pull request or deployment.

## Credit and debt management

- Added atomic member-initiated debt repayment through `/repay-debt`.
- Supports partial and full repayment; a repayment cannot exceed either the member's available credits or outstanding debt.
- Future ticket and invite rewards automatically pay down outstanding debt before adding any remainder to the member's spendable balance. The original gross reward and the debt offset are both recorded in the ledger.
- Records each repayment as a distinct `debt_repayment` transaction in the existing ledger.
- Uses Discord interaction IDs as idempotency keys so retrying the same interaction cannot deduct credits twice.
- Serializes PostgreSQL repayment operations by locking the member's balance row.
- Updated `/balance` to show available credits, outstanding debt, and net position.
- Updated `/credits` to show available credits to all members, while limiting another member's debt details to that member, the server owner, Administrators, and configured dashboard moderators.

## Credit history

- Added `/credit-history` with 10 entries per page, newest first.
- Members can view their own history. Viewing another member's history requires Administrator or configured moderator access.
- Reuses the existing transaction ledger; no parallel history table is introduced.

## Diagnostics

- Added owner-only `/diagnostics`.
- Checks database connectivity, core tables, audit-channel availability, and the bot's audit-channel permissions.
- Does not display connection strings, credentials, or secret values.

## Report navigation

- Added page navigation and optional category filtering to `/reports`.
- Database report queries now support bounded limits, offsets, status filters, and category filters.

## Tests added

- `tests/test_debt_repayment.py`: partial/full repayment, invalid amounts, no debt, insufficient credits, overpayment, idempotency conflicts, ledger entries, credit-history pagination, and automatic ticket-reward debt offsets.
- `tests/test_report_pagination.py`: non-overlapping pages, category filtering, and all-category pagination.
- `tests/test_credit_privacy.py`: self, owner, Administrator, configured moderator, ordinary member, Manage Server-only, and non-guild debt-visibility boundaries; verifies `/credits` only queries and displays debt after authorization.

## Verification still required

- Run the complete unittest suite against the branch.
- Validate PostgreSQL behavior against a real PostgreSQL instance, not only SQLite.
- Test Discord command registration and owner/staff permission boundaries in a separate test server.
- Verify audit-log delivery and report navigation in Discord before deployment.
